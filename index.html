            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, Welcome to Food Corner, A Singapore based food blog with Sri Lankan Recipes & other recipes tried &
                tasted by
                me & family members.I am Amila Gamage. I am a Sri Lankan living in Singapore. I learned almost all my
                cooking
                from the recipes found over websites. However when I looked for some Sri Lankan recipes, I couldnâ€™t find
                the
                exact recipe or taste as I wanted. I tried to adjust the way of cooking those Sri Lankan recipes
                reminding the
                way my mother & other some Sri Lankans cooked. Finally, I thought of filling the gap by sharing those
                Sri Lankan
                recipes with others.My Food blog is a result of that! ðŸ™‚ And I started this blog in 2011.</p>
